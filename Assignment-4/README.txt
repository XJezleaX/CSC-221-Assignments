Basic Android Quiz App:

QuizMe is an application designed to test the user's knowledge with a set of questions revolving around TV/Films, Greek History, video games, etc. The score-based system allows users to gain points for correct answers and view their results at the end of the quiz.

Required Packages: Java, Gradle (Target SK and Compile SDK changed to 34)
Programmed on: Android Studio

Building/Compiling the Application: 
This can be used on any Android device or through an emulator. This program was tested using Android Studio's emulator, specifically the Pixel 6 API 31 phone. To set up a device emulator go to Device Manager in Android Studio and click Create Device. You may choose to use the same setup as me and download the S package for it, or pick another device option. Once the device is created run the program and the main screen will appear.

Once the program begins hit the begin button and the quiz will automatically start. Each button choice you pick will either have a potential for one point if correct or no points if wrong. At the end, all your points will be tallied up.
